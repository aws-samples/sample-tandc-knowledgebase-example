# 3.9 Shared Responsibility Model & AWS Acceptable Policy

Now, one last touch before get startedwith this course.I will be referring tothe Shared Responsibility Model quite a lot.And you will see this diagram at the end of this course.This is what define what is your responsibilityversus AWS when using the cloudand there is a shared responsibility.You as a customer, you're responsiblefor the security in the cloud.So whatever you use in the cloud,however you configure it is your entire responsibility.That includes security, your data, your operating system,your network and firewall configuration, et cetera.And AWS is going to be responsiblefor the security of the cloud.So all the infrastructure, all the hardware,all the software, all their own internal security,they are responsible of.And this is why we have shared responsibility.In the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam,you will be asked some questions around findingwhat is your responsibilityand what is the responsibility of AWS.So I just wanted to give you a quick overview of thisand in some sections I will be referring backto this diagram and this model to tell youwhat is your responsibilityand what is the responsibility of AWS.Finally, when you use AWS,you are agreeing to their Acceptable Use Policy,which you can find right hereand I think it's pretty obviousthat you cannot do any illegal,harmful of offensive use or content,you cannot do any security violation,you cannot abuse a networkand you cannot do email or other types of messages abuse.All of that makes sense but it's good to specify it.Now , I hope you're excited.We're gonna get started with this courseand actually get to use the cloud.So, I will see you in the next section.
