# 3.6 Creating an AWS Account

So let's go ahead and create an AWS account.For this, on the website of AWS,I'm going to click on Create accounts.Here, I'm taken to the portal setupand I need to put an email address,called the root user email address,so this is your email address as well as an account name.So next, after you verify your email address,put a password.So the password has constraints.It must be eight characters longand must have at least three of the following:uppercase, lowercase, numbers,and non-alphanumeric characters.And please, please, please, please, please,do not lose your passport.Put it somewhere safe.And next, we have an account plan.So here we can choose between free or paid.So in both cases, you are going to be spending money in AWSand you're going to start with about $100 in creditand you can receive up to 200 in total.The difference between free and paid account planis that in the free plan, you don't put a credit card down,and if you run out of credits,then your account will be closed automatically.In the paid account, this is where you're going to haveproduction-ready workloads,and so you're going to put your credit card down,and in case you go over your credits, then you're going to,of course, be charged on your credit card.So for us to learn AWS safely,we're going to use a free account,and this will be enough for this course.In case you need to do some things that are paid,AWS is going to prompt you to add a new credit cardand you will be free to do so if you choose to.But these amount of credits should be enough for us,more than enough for us, to learn AWS together safely.So let's go ahead and choose free plan.And then we put in our contact information for AWS.So this is a personal project.Here's my full name,and then I'll just enter more information.So here you have to enter your credit card number.So this is necessary even if you have a free plan.The reason why they want you to have a credit cardis that they want to verify your account and prevent fraud.So if you have a free plan,even if you put a credit card number down,you're going to have no chargesuntil you actually upgrade to a paid plan.So this is a safe way to put your credit card info,but don't worry, you're not going to be charged.Just $1 is going to be used for the verification process.And of course, that moneyis going to be refunded to you right away.Next, we must confirm our identityby providing a phone number.And then you may be prompted for a support plan,and here, I just choose basic support, which is free,and then complete the signup.Now, your account is being activatedand we should receive an email when it's complete.And finally, I am logged in the UI.If somehow you don't see this pageand you just need to log in the UI again, just sign out.And when you sign out, click on Sign in to console.And by clicking on it, you can go to here, this page,and here, you're going to click onSign in using root user email.And actually, we have an improved sign-in,so this is the one.So root user, then you enter your email addressthat you used during sign-up,and you may be prompted with this upon sign-in.Do not worry, we're going to take care of thisduring the course, so just skip for now.And you're back in the AWS console and you're good to go.That's it. You've created an account.Congratulations.I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
