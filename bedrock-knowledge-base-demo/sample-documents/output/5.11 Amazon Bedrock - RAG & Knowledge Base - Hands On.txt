# 5.11 Amazon Bedrock - RAG & Knowledge Base - Hands On

Okay, so we're goingto practice Knowledge Bases in RAG.And so for this,you go to the left hand side under builder toolsand you will find Knowledge Bases.So here we have the option to create Knowledge Base,and that will take a lot of time.But to get the idea behind how a Knowledge Base is working,we're going to do here a chat with your document.And the idea is that we're going to upload documentand chat with it.And we can imagine this documentwould be in a vector databaseand then our model would do right against it.So,here we're going to have an Anthropic Modelof 3.5 Sonnets,and,we have the parameters here that we can set,but we're not gonna touch anything.Everything is set up as it should.And here the important partis the chat prompt templates.So we can edit to see what it is.So it says," you are a question answering agent,I will provide you with a set of search resultsand the user will provide you with a question,and your job is to answer the user's questionusing only the information from the search results.And if there's no result in it,please state that you cannot find the answerto the question."So, here the important thing is that,search results are going to be performedfrom within our document that we're going to uploadand based on the query of the user.And then,this combined with our questionis going to generate outputs.So this is the whole idea behind it, right.Number one is to find the informationwithin document with a search.And number two is to pass that informationfrom the search to a modelthat will be generating the answer.So we're going to add data from our computer,and you can download it from the codeat the beginning of the course.Just look again in section one and two,or two.And under Bedrock,you will click on Evolution of the Internet Detailed.And this is just a documentthat contains some information on the internetthat we're going to chat with.So we're good here,we're happy with it.Streaming preference, we're all good.And guardrails,we're all good as well.So let's go ahead.And for this,on the right hand side, here we go, we can say,who and when inventedthe World Wide Web?And so here we get an answer directlyfrom the model.And it says when it was invented and by whom,and we have sources.And so here, if we click on this,we have a source directly coming from our document,and here a source coming directly from our document.So you can click on show detailsto really have a look at it.And so source chunk one is coming from here,from our document.And source chunk two is coming from here,from our document.And so this is pretty cool because well,all this information is coming from our documentand then this was passed to our modeland our model generated this summarizing answer as a result.We can say, for example,what is the future of AI?And we're getting too many requests,so I need to wait a little bit.And so here again,we have this information right here,and we can click on show detailsto view the sources.And remember from our first promptif we have something...How to make guacamole?Well, if you ask a question that has nothing to dowith the documents,we need to just wait a little bit,then our model should not respondbecause it doesn't have the information necessary.And as we can see here,we get an apology from the modelbecause it cannot find guacamolein the search results that were provided.So that's it for this lecture,we've seen how RAG is workingand how Knowledge Base is working.I hope you liked itand I will see you in the next lecture.
