# 3.4 The Different Types of Cloud Computing

As we will see in this course,there are different types of cloud computingand it is important for us to be able to recognize them.The first one is called Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS.This is to provide the building blocks for cloud IT.With this IAAS, we're going to provide networking,computers and data storage space in its raw form.And using these building blocks, (indistinct)building LEGOs,We're going to be given a very high level of flexibilityand we can easily understandhow we can migrate from traditional on-premises ITto the cloud.Then we're gonna get platform as a service.In this, we're going to remove the needfor your organizationto manage the underlying infrastructure,and you can just focus on the deploymentand management of your applications.And then one step even further is softwareas a service or SaaS.This is a completed product that is going to be runand managed by the service provider.So if you wanna compare all these things, well,let's look at an example.On premises, you're going to manage everything.So your applications, your data, your runtime,your middleware, the operating system, virtualization,servers, storage and networking.And that's a lot.With IaaS, so infrastructure as a service, we're goingto manage the application, the data, the runtime,the malware, and the OS.But all the virtualization servers, storageand networking are going to be managed by others.And in our case, AWS.With platform as a service, we manage even less.So everything from the runtimeto the networking is managed by AWS.And the only thing we care about when we use a platformas a service is our application and our data.And finally, well, if you're using software as a service,everything is going to be managed by AWS.So well, how does it translate?Well, with IaaS, we can use Amazon EC2 on AWS,but we have other services, such as Google Cloud,Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean and Linode,which will provide us a cloud computing infrastructureas a service.Platform as a service also exists on AWSwith Elastic Beanstalk.And we'll see all the services obviously in this course.And outside of AWS, we have Heroku, Google App Engine,and Windows Azure.For software as a service,we'll also have this on AWS that represents many servicesof AWS, for example, Rekognition where we wantto do some machine learning,but we've been using it as well in the real worldwith Google Apps, such as Gmail or Dropboxor Zoom for your meetings.So the Cloud has different flavors,but one thing is commonis that the pricing is very different from what you know.AWS has three pricing fundamentalsand it will follow the pay-as-you-go pricing model.So for the compute, and that represents various services,we're going to pay for the exact compute time.For the storage, we're going to pay for the exact amountof data stored in the cloud.And for the networking, we're goingto only pay when the data leaves the cloud.Any data that goes into the cloud is free.And this solves the expensive issue of traditional ITbecause now we only pay exactly what we need.And so we have huge cost savings ahead of us.So that's it for this lecture.In the next lecture, we'll be having a deeper dive on AWS.
