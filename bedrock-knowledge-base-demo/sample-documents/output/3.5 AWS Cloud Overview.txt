# 3.5 AWS Cloud Overview

Now let's look at the historyof the AWS Cloud.It was launched in 2002 internally at amazon.combecause they realized that the IT departmentscould be externalized.Their Amazon infrastructure was one of their core strengthsand they said, you know what?"Maybe we can do IT for someone else, for other people."So they launched their first offering publicly,which was SQS in 2004.In 2006, they expanded their offeringand they relaunched with the availability of SQS S3 and EC2.Don't worry, we'll see all these services in this course.Then they expanded and said, you know what?"We don't have to be just in America.We could be in Europe."And then fast forward to today, we have so many applicationsthat used to run, or are still running on AWS,such as Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb, or even the NASA.Now let's look at where AWS is today.If you look at the Magic Quadrant from Gartner,you can see that AWS is a leader,and it has been the case for many, many years.AWS now has $90 billion in revenue as of 2023,and it accounts for about 31% of the market in Q1 2024,with Microsoft being second with 25%.It's been a pioneer and a leader of the marketfor 13th consecutive years,and it has over 1 million active users.So, learning AWS really sets you upfor success in the cloud world.What can you build on AWS?Well, pretty much everything.AWS will enable you to build sophisticatedand scalable applications,and they are applicable to a diverse set of industries.Every company has a use case for the cloud.Netflix, McDonald's, 21st Century Fox, Activision,they're all using the cloud.And use cases can includejust transferring your enterprise IT,or using the cloud as a backup and storage,or doing some big data analytics.You can also host a website,or create a backend for your mobileand your social applications,or you can have your entire gaming serversrunning on the cloud.The applications are endless.Now, AWS is global,and this is where we are going to learn a bit more specificsabout how it works.We have AWS regions, we have availability zones,data centers, edge locations, and points of presence.And all of these can be represented on the map right here.Let's go on this website to have a quick look at it.This is a cool map,because on this website we can see how AWS is global.If I click on it, I can scroll the worldand see what is happening.We can see that AWS has multiple regions,and they're in orange and they're all around the world.For example, Paris, in Spain, in Ohio, in Sao Paulo,Cape Town, Mumbai, and everywhere else.AWS truly is a global service.On top of it, each region are going to be connectedthrough the network.These are the network reconnecting the regions,and this is a private network of AWS.And then within each region, for example,if I really scroll into the Cape Town region,we can see that we have blue dots,and each blue dots will be availability zonesthat will be describing in the next slide.As we can see, what I want to get you out of thisis that AWS truly is global,and we can leverage the infrastructure of a cloud providerto make ourselves, or application global.The first important concept in AWS are regions.Regions are all around the world, and we saw it on the mapfrom before the regions have a name.It could be US-east-1, EU-West-3,and we can see the mapping of the name of the regionto their code on the console that we'll see in a minute.Now, a region, what is in its truly...Well, it's going to be a cluster of data centers.Many different data centers look at it in near,for example, Ohio, or Singapore, or Sydney, or Tokyo.When we use AWS services,most services are going to be linked in scopeto a specific region.That means that if we use a service in one regionand we try to use it in another region,it will be like a new time of using the service.Now, a question that may come up in the examis how do you choose an AWS region?Say you're launching a new application,where should you do it?Should you do it in America, in Europe,in South America, or in Australia?Well, the answer is of course, it depends.But let's look at some factors that may impact your choiceof an AWS region.The first one is compliance.Sometimes governments want the data to be localto the country you're deploying the application in.For example, France,data in France may have to stay in France,and therefore you should launch your applicationin the French region.Then there is also a concept of latency.If most of your users are going to be in America,it makes a lot of sense to deploy your applicationin America close to your users,because they will have a reduced latency.If you deploy your application in Australia,and your users are in America,they will have a lot of lag using your application.Then also, not all regions have all services, okay?Some regions do not have services,and so obviously if you're leveraging a servicewith your application, you need to make surethat the region you're deploying into is available,and does have that service.And finally, pricing.Pricing does vary from region to region,and you need to consult the appli...The services pricing pages to seewhat the differences are between the regions.But this could be obviously a factorthat could impact your deploymentof an application into a specific region.Now, availability zones arewhat actually are going into the region.Each region will have many availability zones,usually three, the minimum is three, and the max is six,but really the usual is three.So let's take the Sydney region as an example.The Sydney region code is ap-southeast-2.We have two have three availability zones in Sydney,ap-southeast-2A, ap-southeast-2B,and ap-southeast-2C.Now, each of these availability zones are going to be oneor more discrete data centersthat will have redundant power networking and connectivity.That means that in southeast-2A,I can have two data centers maybe as well,2 and 2B, and 2 and 2C.But it could be one, it could be three, it could be four.We don't really know, it always doesn't tell us that.But what we know is that these availability zonesare separate from each otherso that they will be isolated from disasters.If something happens to ap-southeast-2A,we know that it is designed not to cascadeinto ap-southeast-2B, or ap-southeast-2C.They're really isolated from disasters.And then these data centers, these availability zones,they are connected with high bandwidth,ultra-low latency networking, and therefore,altogether being linked together,it will form a region.Okay, next, the only thing we need to know about AWSfor the global infrastructureis the points of presence or edge locations.We will see them in details in the global sectionof this course, but you should knowthat AWS has more than 400 points of presence in 90 cities,across 40 countries.And this will be very helpful when we deliver contentto the end users with the lowest latency possible.And this is what you see on this map.Now, again, I'm going quickly over thisbecause we'll see this at the...About the middle of this course.Now how about we just play aroundand do a tour of the consult?We'll see that AWS has global services such as IAM,Route 53, CloudFront and WAF,but we'll see that also, most AWS servicesare going to be region scoped, such as Amazon EC2,Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, and Rekognition.Finally, to know if a service is available in your region,there is a region table you should check out right here.
