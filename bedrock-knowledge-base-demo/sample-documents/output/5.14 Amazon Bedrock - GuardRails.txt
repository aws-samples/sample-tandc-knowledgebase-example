# 5.14 Amazon Bedrock - GuardRails

Now let's talk about Guardrailsin Amazon Bedrock.Guardrails allow you to control the interactionbetween your users and your Foundation Models.You can set up Guardrails to filterundesirable and harmful content.For example, say we have Amazon Bedrockand we set up a Guardrail to block any kind of food recipes,and the user is using your modeland saying," Hey, suggest me something to cook tonight."Then Amazon Bedrock will respond,"Sorry, this is a restricted topic."This is because we have set up a Guardrailto block this topic.Of course, maybe you don't wanna block food recipes,but something a bit more relevant to your business.You can al use Guardrailsto remove any personally identifiable informationor PII, to make sure that your users are safe.You can also enhance privacy,and you can reduce hallucinations.We'll see what hallucinations are later on this course.But the idea is that you wanna make surethat the answers are safe and soundand that they're not just invented off the block.Guardrails can help you with that.You can also create multiple Guardrailsand multiple level of Guardrails.And you can also monitor and analyze all the user inputsthat will violate the Guardrails to make surethat you have set the Guardrails up properly.That's it, just a short intro to the Guardrail.I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
