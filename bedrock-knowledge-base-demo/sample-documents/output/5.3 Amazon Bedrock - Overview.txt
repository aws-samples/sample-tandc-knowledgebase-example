# 5.3 Amazon Bedrock - Overview

So now let's talk about Amazon Bedrock.So Amazon Bedrock is the one service on AWSthat we're going to use to build generative AI applications.So it's very powerful,and it allows you through an interfaceto play with many models and configure themin order to get the outcome you want.So it's called a fully managed service.That means that for you, there is no service to manage.You just use the service on AWSand Amazon Web Services will make surethat the service is working for you.So you're going to keep control of all the datayou're going to use to train the model,because it all happens within your account.It never leaves your accounts.You're going to have a pay-per use pricing model,but we'll go into the pricing model later on as well.There's a unified API, so that means thatto access Amazon Bedrockand the many models behind Amazon Bedrock,you only have one way of doing it, which is standardized.You can leverage a wide array of foundation models.We'll have a look at them in a second.And on top of it, you have advanced features such as RAGor LLM agents, and you get security, privacy, governance,and responsible AI features as well within Amazon Bedrock.So we're going to spend a bit of time learning about itand practicing together.So what type of foundation models do we have access toon Amazon Bedrock?Well, many companies have agreements with AWSto publish their models on Bedrock.So we have AI21 Labs, we have Cohere,we have Stability.ai, we have of course Amazon themselves.We have Anthropic, Meta, Mitral AI.And of course, over time more foundation modelsand more companies behind these modelsare going to be added into Amazon Bedrock.So the way it works that whenever you useone of these models, there's going to,Amazon Bedrock is going to make a copyof the foundation model, the FM,and it's going to be only available to you.And then in some cases, you are going to be ableto use your own data to fine tune the model to your needs.Again, you need to know that none of your datais going to be used and sent back to one of these providersto train the foundation model.What you get happens all within your accountand only within your account.So it's always helpful to get a diagramto understand a service.So I made one for Amazon Bedrock.So we have at the center of it, foundation models,and those are the ones we've seen.And we'll have a look in the hands-onto see how we can select them.And we're going to have an interactive playgroundthat we're going to have a look at itas well in the next lecture in which us, as a user,we're going to select a model we want to use.And then we're going to start asking questions to the model.For example, "What is the most popular dish in Italy?"And then maybe the playground is going to respond,"Pizza and pasta."On top of it, this is just for the basic interactions,but we can have also knowledge bases or RAG,and we'll have a full lecture dedicated to this.So don't worry if you don't understand it right now.But the idea is that we're going to be ableto provide more relevant and more accurate responsesby fetching data from external data sourcesthat may have the answer for us.Don't worry, we'll have a deep diveinto knowledge bases as well.We can fine tune our foundation model.That means that we're going to bring our own dataand we're going to update the foundation modelin our account, again, with our data to make surethat it's more adapted to our use case and our data.And finally, to access all of these thingsis going to be a unified API.So it's going to be the same for all models.That means that all your applicationsjust talk in one way, to Amazon Bedrock,and then Amazon Bedrock will do the magic for us.So that's it for this lecture.I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecturefor some practice on Amazon Bedrock.
