# 1.2 Important- Course Structure

Hello, and welcometo the AWS Certified AI Practitioner course.My name is Stephane Maarek,and I will be your instructor for this course.So I just need about five minutes of attentionjust to make sure we are on the same page,and then we will get started with this course.So we are going to prepare for a certification from AWScalled the AWS Certified AI Practitioner.And the exam code is a AIF-C01.So this is an AI-focused certification.It's less focused on the AWS Cloud itself.So if you're looking for a courseon the AWS Cloud itself,this is not the one.You may want to do Certified Cloud Practitioneror Certified Solutions Architect Associate.In this course, having basic IT knowledgeis going to be very helpful.We are going to cover over 20 AWS AI services.And if you're a beginner on AWS and IT,you are welcome,but take your time, it's not a race,and you may have to look up a few things.I'll do my best to explain everything,but sometimes that basic, basic knowledge I don't offer.So this course is about learning by doing.That means that you're going to have both theory lecturesand hands-on.And I try to have as many diagrams as possibleand visuals to help you learn.So I want to make sure that you exactly understandwhat this course is and isn't.So this is not a course on how to use ChatGPT.This is not a course on how to use other AI tools,such as how to create imagesor how to generate music.And this is not a courseon all the AI tools that exist out there.This is also not a course on how to usethe AWS Cloud properly.For this, I really invite youto look at the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner courseor the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course.So what this course is thoughis that it's intended for IT professionalswho want to learn about AIand to do a deep diveon all the AI servicesthat are offered by AWS.So the goal of this courseis really to help you passwhat I call a technical certificationthat is administered by AWS.So hopefully we are on the same pageand you are in the right place.If you feel that this is not the courseyou were looking for,no worries, just ask for a refundon the Udemy user interfaceand you'll be good to go.So about me, well, I'm Stephane,and I have over 11 AWS certifications.I've worked with AWS for many, many years.I've built websites, apps,streaming platforms,and I've been teaching AWSfor now over seven or eight years.So that includes certificationsor specified services,such as CloudFormation, Lambda and EC2.I've taught millions of studentsand almost got a million reviews.So you should be in good hands.You can connect with me on LinkedInwhere you can follow me,on Instagram as well, Medium,Twitter and GitHub.So you are getting an AWS Certificationand there are different levels to it,so we are on the foundational level,and so we have the Cloud Practitioner Foundationaland we have the AI Practitioner Foundational level.This is what we're doing right now.You also have Associate level,they are more advanced type of certifications.Then you have Professional,they're even more advanced.And Specialty, where you specialize in a specific area.Right now we are at the Foundational level,which is the start,and you get a really good overviewabout the AWS Cloud,as well as the AI services on AWS.
