# 5.4 Amazon Bedrock - Hands On

Okay, so let's use Amazon Bedrockand please go on the top rightand make sure you are in US East One for region,because this is where I found that Bedrock works best.So then you click on Amazon Bedrock,and then you get started.And then we have the overview page of Bedrock.So what I wanna show you first is around the providers.So Bedrock is hosting a lot of modelsfrom different providers.As you can see right now we have eight providers.It's very possible that in the futureyou will have more providers.I will only add this videoif it makes sense to show them to you,but the most important onesare going to be discussed in this course.So as you can see, you have a AI21 Labs, Amazon anthropic,you have Deepseek, Meta and so on.So a lot of models are available to you.And if you click on a specific provider, for example,if you click on Amazon, you are redirected to a pagewhere you get some information around the provider,a spotlight, the model overview.So to understand what model does what, for example,Nova Micro is a text only model.And then you have access to all the models in the bottom.And so for each model, for example,if you click on Nova Pro,you get description around the model itself.So you know the categories that this model is goingto be helpful for.So all of these things, the version.And then for the usage, you get some information around API.And so actually Bedrock is something we're goingto be using in the console right now,but if you wanted to integrate Bedrockinto your application, you would need to use API request.And so this is where AWS is giving youhow to use API requests for this specific type of model.So all of this is very helpfuland what we need to do now isto actually get access to these models.Okay, so next, let's get access to our models.And for this, you scroll downand you will find model access on the bottom left.And we can see all the models that are available to us.And it could be more, it could be less.And then you're going to click on enable all modelsto just enable them all.So enabling a model does not cost you any money,but using a model may cost you money.And if you want to follow this course,you first need to enable the modelsand then you need to use the models.We try to keep cost at a minimum,but nothing is free in the AI world.So you click on them all, you click on next,and then you click on submit.And there you go.You have access to all these modelsand it's gonna take a while for you to get accessto some of them, but you need to wait a little bit.Sometimes you will get an error.So because you'll have to actually get accessto a specific model by saying yes to a license and so on.Do not worry so much about this.We have enough models to deal with.Some of these are granted instantaneously.Some of these are in progress. It just takes a bit of time.So I'm just going to pause the videoand wait here until we're done.So now let's practice using these models.You go on the left hand side on their playgroundsand you click on chat text.And we're first going to select single prompt,and we're going to select a model.We'll take Amazonand we'll choose Nova Micro and apply this.So this is the cheapest, most accessibleon demand model from AWS.And as you can see, the throughput is on demand.That means that for every request we're going to pay.So we have a few parameters over herethat we'll see in greater details later on.But let's start by just asking a a question.So what is AWS?And this is our prompt that we do onto Amazon Bedrock.And so Amazon Bedrock is goingto send the request into this specific model, get the reply,and then we get the reply right here.So we get some information around AWSwith some key aspects of AWS.So one, two and and three, and four all the way.And this is a nice reply.So we get some information aroundhow many input tokens were used.So this is good for pricing.How many help output tokens were generated?Again, very, very important for pricing.What the latency, so how long it tookfor the model to reply.And those are important statistics.You have another mode called the chat mode.And here you can have a whole conversation with an ai,but it will keep the context in it.So you can still use Amazon, for example,you can use Nova Pro.Or if you wanted, you could use the Anthropic model.For example, Claude 3.5.So next, and here again,we have more parameters if you wanted to specify them,but here we can just say, what is AWS again?We click on run.And here we get the answer directly from this model.And as you can see, the answer is very different.So first of all, you will never get twice the same answerfrom the same model.But if you go across models, the writing styleand the writing quality will vary a lot.And actually the less performant model,the cheaper model will usually have an outputthat will be of quality a bit lowerthan the more expensive models.But the question is, what is an acceptablelevel of quality for you?So here we have 12 input tokens, 361 output token.Here is the latency, and we have a full conversation.The good thing about this is that some models, for example,will accept attachments.So here I'm able to attach something into this promptand use this attachment as part of my prompt,which is something that not all models will have.And finally, let's have a look at the image and video.So here we can actually generate images and video.So we'll just use the image generator.So we'll use for example,Nova Canvas in here and apply it.And this is to generate an image,but we have different things.We can also generate variations, remove objects,replace objects, replace the background,or remove a background.So a lot of image tooling available to usand a lot as well of options into how you wantto generate that image.So this is more advanced,but for example say "Generate an orange backpackwith the AWS logo on iton someone that is teaching live AWS workshop."So this is quite a complete prompt.Let's see how the model is going to do for this.And okay, we're getting some things.So we're getting this orange backpackwith the AWS logo on it.We don't have the teaching part.I was trying something maybe too hard for this model,but we get the idea that we can generate imagesdirectly from Amazon Bedrock.Okay, so this is good for our first introduction.So we've seen the different providers.We've seen how to activate models and enable them.We've seen how to play with text,with chat, and with images.So this is our intro to Bedrock.We'll see a lot more features obviously,but hopefully you get the idea of howto use generative AI on AWS.All right, that's it.I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
