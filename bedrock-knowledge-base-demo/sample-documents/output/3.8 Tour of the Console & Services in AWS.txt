# 3.8 Tour of the Console & Services in AWS

So welcome to the AWS Console Home.And in this page, you can do a lot of things.So first of all, let's have a lookat the top right corner of your screen,right now, this is what's called the regions selector,and right now I am in Northern Virginia,US east one.But it is advised for this course tochoose a region that is geographically close to you.So because I'm in Europe, I'm actually close to Ireland.So I can choose EU west one.But if you are in other regions of the world, for exampleif you're in Africa and you're close to Capetownthen choose this.Of course you don't have to physically bein that region to use that region, okay?You can for examplechoose whatever region makes sense for you.So choose whatever is closestand this will give you the lowest amount of latency.Next in the console console, you will see a listof recently visited servicesand it should be empty for you.And I just tried that oneso it's showing one right here for me.On the bottom you get some information about AWS.You get the health issues, if need beand cost and usage info for your accountsas well as tutorials to build a solution and so on.So this webpage is actually changing a lot over timelesschanged a lot for the past two years.And so it may not look exactly the same as youand in case it looks very, very, very different.I will rerecord this lecture.Okay, so once we have thiswe need to look at services of AWS.And for this two options,the first one is to go on the top left click on servicesand you can either look at servicesby alphabetical order, as you can seethere are a lot of services on AWS,or by category for example, for computeyou will have all these services and so on.But don't worry over time,we will learn these servicesand we don't have to navigate that page.Another thing I really like is the search bar.So you can actually type a service for example, route 53and then it gives you search results.So it gives you four services that match this query, okay?And then within these services,we can also have a look at featuresand 13 features match them.So we can directly jump into the domain namesof the route 53 service and it's a good thing.We can also look at blogs, knowledge articlesdocumentations and so on.So this is quite cool.Let's go into route 53 now to have a look at this console.So this one is very special becauseon the top right hand side, it says global.That means that this consoledoes not require a region selection.And that is more of the exception than the rule,but some services in AWS are whereit's called global services and no matter where you areyou're going to get the same view.But if you switch services and you go, for exampleto the EC two service,this time on the top right hand side,as you can see it says Irelandbecause I chose the Ireland region.And so based if I run this console in Irelandor say in another region, for example, in Canada,well my view is going to be differentin terms of the resources that I will see.So that's why it's important for you to remainwithin the same region for the entire durationof this tutorial and this course.The other thing you can look atis called the AWS global infrastructurethat you can find on Google.And this gives you a lotof information around your services.And one thing that is very important to look atis the AWS regional services.And it gives you the services list by region.And so this is table,and so for example, if in the course,I talk about a service and do a hands on,but it doesn't seem to be in your region,you can check here and find the availability of services.So for example, we can check a look,have a look for Cape townand see the services that are available in this region.And if you don't see a servicemaybe you need to switch a regionin of course the console,to have access to itbecause not all the services from AWS are in every region.So that's it for this lecture,I hope you liked itand I will see you in the next lecture.
