# 1.4 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)-

So artificial intelligence is going to bethe main topic of this course, of course,but I want to give you a shortand very, very high level introduction to AIto know what you're getting into.This may be obvious for you,this may be less obvious for some, so don't worry.I just wanna put everyone on the same levelas we go along in this course.So what is artificial intelligence?Well, it is the field of computer sciencededicated to solving problemsthat we commonly associate with human intelligence.So what can it be?For example, it could be image creation,where the AI is going to generate an imagethat you want based on requirements.It could be image recognition.So for example, your car is going to have a lookat the stop signs on the street and know when to stop.It could be speech to text.For example, right now I'm speakingand I know that my words are being transcribedinto captions by an AI.There's also for learning.So AI has the ability to adapt to the problems you haveand therefore giving youa very specialized learning experience.But for now, right now you're learning from meand I promise you, I am a human.So how does artificial intelligence work?Well, we're going to have a look at itin great details in this course,but I want to give you a general understanding of itso we know where we're going.So usually AI, at least in the modern termand the modern sense of it, has a training data set.So training data sets could be whatever data you want.In this example, I have a lot of fruits.I have peaches, bananas, and apples.And someone, usually a data scientist,is going to take this data setand is going to train a model.Now training model is basically some codethat has some statistical abilitiesand a model is born out of it.We will look in great details how this works.And for now, let's just understand that there is a modeland it's basically just smart computer codethat is being generated thanks to the data.And so here is an example of one of these algorithmsyou can understand, which is a classification algorithm.So the AI model is going to place all the fruitson two axis, or it could be a lot more axis,but two for now is easy to understand.And basically, it's going to group the data together.And we're going to say in a classification algorithmthat the first one is peaches,and this is where the peaches are on my graph.Then we have the bananas togetherand then we have the apples together.And how to determine this groupand how to place these elements on this graphis basically what the data scientisttrains the AI model to do.Now, us as a user, so this is the backend preparationof the model type of stuff,and us as a user, we're going to be using the model.And how do we use the model?Well, we show a new image to the modelthat it hasn't seen before.So this image of apple has never been seen beforebecause look at the training data sets,the three images of applesthat existed before are different.And so we give a new image of an apple,but the model has been trained on so many images,not nine of them, but millions of them,that in the end it recognizes that yes,this is again an apple because it would classify iton the diagram next to all the other apples.So AI works like this.Now there are tons of different algorithms.There's tons of different ways to train your model,to have your data and so on,and we'll do a deep dive on all of this,but you have hopefully now a better understandingof how AI works.So let's go back in timebecause I think it's important for you to understandwhere we are with AI today.So computer science is very newbecause well, before we didn't have computer.And so in the 1950s, this was the birth of AI.So Alan Turing, who was a mathematicianand the person that helps really makethe whole computer science field exist,proposes something called the Turing test.And the Turing test is saying thatthe machine has intelligenceif it's able to have a conversation with a humanand fool the human into making the human thinkthat the human is speaking to another human.So if the computer can pretend it's a humanand a human cannot detect this,then we have achieved artificial intelligence.And there's another person called John McCarthy,who is also one of the father of artificial intelligence,who just invented the term.So this is in 1950s and all of this is pretty much a dream.Right now we don't have, at that time,we don't have anything that suggeststhat we will arrive to artificial intelligence,but they still define tests for itand they describe the term.Now in the 1970s, we have what's called expert systems.And expert systems are like the MYCIN expert system,which is an AI rule-based system to detect bacterias.So you will see this in greater detail as well,but you were to answer questions, a lot of them,and then the expert system,which would be one of the first AI,would say we think you have this bacteriaand then we propose some kind of treatments.And in the 1990s, we have the new fieldof machine learning and data mining.So it's not a dream anymore.Our computers are becoming more and more powerful.We can collect data, we can organize it,and we start to have statistical breakthroughs in maththat allows us to design algorithmsto start doing machine learning.In 1997, Deep Blue is here.And Deep Blue is an AI by IBM,which has the power to defeat the world championof chess at a time, Garry Kasparov.And it does it by just doing a lot of computations,analyzing the best moves and playing.But this is a big one because, well,before computers would always lose against chess players,or not always, but against the good ones at least,but this was the first timethat a computer would beat a world champion.Then in 2010, we have the deep learning revolution.So this is where we are going to have neural networksand the type of algorithms today that you see in modern AI.And this is big because now we really have the powerto give true intelligence to our AI models.And so in 2016, there's Google,which creates a algorithm and AI named AlphaGo,defeating the Go world champion, Lee Sedol in 2016.And this is big because Go is a very advanced game,more advanced than chess in a way that like,you cannot compute all the possible moveslike you would in chess.And so therefore, the algorithm that IBM employedfor Deep Blue did not work for Google AlphaGo.So a new approach was needed.And this was Google DeepMind.And this was really a revolutionbecause we unlocked a new stage of AI.And nowadays we have AI in everyday life.So we have virtual systems, autonomous vehicles,healthcare diagnostics, we have chatbots,we have discussion ethics and regulations.And this is why nowadays we are learningabout AI in practical terms.So I want to give you a few more use cases for AI.So we have good abilities now to transcribeand translate spoken language,which allows humans to communicate very easily,even if they don't speak the same language.We have the games and the games are very,very big fields of research in AI,because well, it seems simple,but this is where the breakthroughs happenand they get applied to everyday life.So we have chess, Go, StarCraft, and so on.AI is now able to help us drive cars or to fly airplanes,to do speech recognition and generation.So we can generate voices that look very human-likenowadays, thanks to AI.Good developers that write code also have now co-pilots,which allows them to get suggestions for code.And this is big because it has improved the productivityof many, many developers.Doctors are using AI to get assistedin their medical diagnosis.For example, to find a brain tumor,there's multiple occasions where your AIdoes see something that humans don't see.So this is a very good collaboration.We have, from a more business perspective,the automation of many business processesthat used to be done manually,but now can be fully automated thanks to AI agents.And in the field of fraud detection,the anti-fraud algorithms arebecoming more and more advancedthanks to your AI,which allows to catch more frauds ahead of time.So here is a practical example of how AI can be used.It's called IDP, or Intelligent Document Processing.So say, for example, we have an invoice.Someone takes a picture of an invoiceand they put the image in a PDF file,and we're supposed to extract the data out of this invoiceto insert it into a invoice processing system.So here we have an AI, which is specialized in IDP,and is going to process and extract data from this document.For these, there's gonna be several sub-AIsthat are going to be leveraged.For example, computer vision,to be able to see the image and interpret it.Deep learning, to be able to understand how things workfrom an image perspective as well.And natural language processing, NLP,because we need to understand what everything meansin order to extract it correctly.So for example, the seller, Example Inc,is going to be extracted by the AI.So is the buyer, that's me, Stephane Maarek,as well as all the items, as well as quantity and price.And this is very important because now all this datacan be automatically inserted into a databasewhere things can be processed much more naturally.And so this is complicated to develop, of course,but it is possible nowadaysand has allowed AI to be in our life.So nowadays, what is AI?So we'll see this diagram a few times in the course.So we have AI, and AI is the overall field, okay?But within AI, we have machine learning.This is when the data is going to be usedto train the AI models.Then we have deep learning.This is when we use something called neural networks,and we'll have a look at those, of course,in details in this course.And then we have generative AI or gen AI.And nowadays, if I tell you,or if I tell anyone on the street that have an AI,they already think about gen AI.So AI is the greater field.Gen AI is what people think about when we talk about AI.So this is chat GPT, when you have a chatbot,or Dell E for image generation and so on.But me, I will try to refer as much as possibleas gen AI for the generative AIand AI for the overall field.Don't worry.We'll have a look at all these things in detail,but this was a short introduction into AI.So I hope you liked it.And I will see you in the next lecture.
