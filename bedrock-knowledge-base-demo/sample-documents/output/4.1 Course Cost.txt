# 4.1 Course Cost

Okay, so let's talk about the course budget.So there is a cost associated with using this coursebecause using the AWS AI Services is not free.If you follow along with meand do the hands-on, you will incur charges.But I do my best to guide you on how to limit them,and I show you what will cost you moneyand how to turn things off.Now, as you see though,I spent all my course recording 31 cents, so it's not a lot,but 14 different services have incurred cost.And of course, if you don't follow closelyand then all of a sudden, you leave things runningor you do use something too much,your course's cost are going to go up.So I want to give you a little of a heads up herejust to make sure that nothing unexpected happens to you.Some services, for example, Amazon Queue, have free trials,but again, with free trials, it's dangerousbecause you don't forget to turn it offand then you have charges.So I will again show you how to turn things off, of course,but very good for you to triple check things in your case.So to make it extra safe, I'm goingto show you in the next lecturehow to set up a course budgetand you set the alarmto whatever amount you feel comfortableso that you make surethat in case you hit your course budget,in case you have a forecast of hitting your course budget,then you'll receive an email notificationand you can have a look at your bill to seewhat is costing you money.So that's it for this lecture.I hope you liked itand I will see you in the next lecture.
