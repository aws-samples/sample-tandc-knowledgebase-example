AWS Lambda Basics

What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

Key Features:
- No servers to manage
- Continuous scaling
- Millisecond billing
- Built-in fault tolerance
- Automatic logging and monitoring

How Lambda Works:
1. Upload your code to Lambda
2. Set up your code to trigger from AWS services, HTTP endpoints, or in-app activity
3. Lambda runs your code only when triggered
4. Pay only for compute time used

Common Use Cases:
- Data processing
- Real-time file processing
- Web applications
- IoT backends
- Mobile backends

Supported Runtimes:
- Python
- Node.js
- Java
- C#
- Go
- Ruby
- Custom runtimes

Lambda Pricing:
- Request charges: $0.20 per 1M requests
- Duration charges: Based on memory allocated and execution time
- Free tier: 1M free requests per month

Best Practices:
1. Keep functions small and focused
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Monitor with CloudWatch
5. Use layers for shared code
6. Optimize memory allocation
7. Use provisioned concurrency for consistent performance

Lambda Limits:
- Maximum execution time: 15 minutes
- Memory: 128 MB to 10,240 MB
- Deployment package size: 50 MB (zipped)
- Temporary disk space: 10 GB
- Environment variables: 4 KB total

Integration with Other AWS Services:
- API Gateway for HTTP APIs
- S3 for file processing
- DynamoDB for database operations
- SNS/SQS for messaging
- EventBridge for event routing
- CloudWatch for monitoring
